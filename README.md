This repository contains the custom pipeline used in the study 'Phylogeny and Ecological Roles Shaping Yeast-Hyphae Morphogenesis in Ophiostomataceae' to:

Identify fungal isolates.
Estimate the ancestral state of dimorphism in Ophiostomataceae fungi.
Test the phylogenetic signal (Pagel's lambda) of morphogenesis within the family.
Explore the relationship between ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) of fungal morphogenesis and lifestyle.
